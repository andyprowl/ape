 - Implement hierarchical scene/mesh model supporting attachments and transforms
 - Introduce "ape" namespace at least for generic/reusable units
 - Allow importing models using Assimp
 - Allow multiple diffuse maps and specular maps for every material
 - Separate renderer from application and meshes (at least the part dealing with setting uniforms)
  - Only couple renderer to shader, mesh/shape coupling will only be at input (attribute) level, not uniform level
  - Extract light and camera setup from Application
 - Separate framework from concrete application (esp. world creation and input handling)
  - Separate application-specific input handling from generic framework
 - Create a library which can be used also from Qt
 - Make it possible to use the classes with both GLFW and with Qt (make it framework-independent in general)
 - Support planar shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
