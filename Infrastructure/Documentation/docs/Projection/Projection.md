# Projection

In the context of computer graphics, **projection** is the process of transforming 3D points 
expressed in *view space* (i.e. points whose coordinates are relative to the *observer*'s
coordinate system) into 2D points in *screen space* (i.e. points whose coordinates are relative to
the screen's coordinate system).
This process is fundamental for rendering 3D-looking graphics on 2D surfaces like computer
monitors.
