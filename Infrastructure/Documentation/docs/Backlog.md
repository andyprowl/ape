 - Extract "Lighting" project out of Rendering
  - Should include both depth mapping and lighting stuff
  - What about the standard renderer/shader?
 - Write tutorial/documentation on gamma correction
 - Write tutorial/documentation on skyboxes
 - Inversion effect no longer seems to work
  - The image is extremely bright
  - Is this related to gamma?
  - I think it looked OK before we did omnidirectional shadow mapping
 - Complete implementation of shadow mapping
  - Tightly fit lighting view matrices to the scene
  - Implement cascaded shadow maps at least for directional lights
  - Fix warning about texture base level and binding using NSight diagnostic tool (the standalone
    application, not the VS plugin)
   - This has been worked around by allowing to turn off debug mode from command line
  - Consider implementing (restoring?) PCF
 - F1 to rotate lights does not work in ApeStudio
 - Performance has dropped a lot in ApeStudio, at least when not plugged to power
  - Try profiling through NSight
 - Shouldn't LightingView cameras have the aspect ratio of the depth map rather than the aspect
   ratio of the display window?
  - In particular for point light shadow maps, if vertical FOV is 90 and AR is not 1, we get a HFOV
   which is greater than (or lower than) 90, which means redundant or insufficient view coverage
 - Qt window resizing has stopped working again
  - In fact it seems even going back to the commit that "fixed" it no longer works
 - Implement normal maps
  - Have AssetLoader read normal maps
  - Have shader apply normal maps
 - EffectSelector, SkyboxSelector, CameraSelector can be instances of the same template
  - Remove duplication by extracting the template
  - Same redundancy for EffectCollection, SkyboxCollection
 - Create depth of field effect
 - Unify the way GLFW windows and QT windows are created
  - Ideally, there should be a single "Engine" class
 - Let shader programs (or at least effects) have names
  - Use that to select the initial effect in ApePlayer and ApeCreator
 - Figure out a good way of reducing duplication in effect shaders
 - Support wireframe rendering
 - Implement techniques to compose effects into chains, possibly reusing a pool of FBOs
 - callers of glViewport should do so through the Window object
 - Implement normal visualization through geometry shaders
 - (Re-)implement glowing based on view position and normal
 - Player camera lookat direction is now different and non-deterministic when ApePlayer starts
  - Works correctly with ApeCreator
 - Introduce different namespaces for packages (not just "ape")
 - Do some performance benchmarking to compare rendering with VAOs and rendering with VBOs
 - QtCreator workflow for setting things up is particularly unwieldy. Make it easier
 - Refactor handling of Texture readout - should probably be part of AssetLoader, not GpuResource
  - Readout of texture introduces dependency on stb
 - Let QtEngine and GLFWEngine own the renderer and its context, and enforce current window when
   constructing them
 - Try and generalize GLFWEngine-based and Qt's event-based approaches
 - Add CMake install target also handling correct deployment of dependencies
 - Support flat shapes/meshes
