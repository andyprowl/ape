 - Skyboxes and effects should belong to RaveCore, not to Rendering
  - Some effects should be in rave\::RaveCore, some in ape\::Rendering
  - Redesign effect readout: EffectReader ---> EffectCollection
  - EffectReader\::readStandardEffects()
  - RaveEffectCollectionBuilder <>--> EffectReader
  - Let skybox readout follow the same design
 - Write tutorial/documentation on skyboxes
 - EffectSelector, SkyboxSelector, CameraSelector can be instances of the same template
  - Remove duplication by extracting the template
  - Same redundancy for EffectCollection, SkyboxCollection
 - Use immutable storage for asset textures loaded from file
 - Implement gamma correction
  - Support and use SRGB internal format for asset textures loaded from file
  - Enable automatic SRGB conversion when writing offscreen texture to target framebuffer
 - Unify the way GLFW windows and QT windows are created
  - Ideally, there should be a single "Engine" class
 - Add support for cube textures
  - Implement skybox
 - Let shader programs (or at least effects) have names
  - Use that to select the initial effect in ApePlayer and ApeCreator
 - Figure out a good way of reducing duplication in effect shaders
 - Support wireframe rendering
 - Implement techniques to compose effects into chains, possibly reusing a pool of FBOs
 - Complete implementation of shadow mapping
  - Implement point light shadows
  - Fix warning about texture base level and binding using NSight diagnostic tool (the standalone
    application, not the VS plugin)
 - callers of glViewport should do so through the Window object
 - Implement normal visualization through geometry shaders
 - (Re-)implement glowing based on view position and normal
 - Implement gamma correction
 - Player camera lookat direction is now different and non-deterministic when ApePlayer starts
  - Works correctly with ApeCreator
 - Introduce different namespaces for packages (not just "ape")
 - Do some performance benchmarking to compare rendering with VAOs and rendering with VBOs
 - QtCreator workflow for setting things up is particularly unwieldy. Make it easier
 - Refactor handling of Texture readout - should probably be part of AssetLoader, not GpuResource
  - Readout of texture introduces dependency on stb
 - Let QtEngine and GLFWEngine own the renderer and its context, and enforce current window when
   constructing them
 - Try and generalize GLFWEngine-based and Qt's event-based approaches
 - Add CMake install target also handling correct deployment of dependencies
 - Support flat shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
