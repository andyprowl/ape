- Point light shadow maps generate artefacts
 - The borders of the 6 view frusta are visible on the ground and on objects
 - Not sure why these black lines are generated
 - glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_SEAMLESS) seems to only eliminate seams between later faces
- Implement frustum culling
    - Use frustum culling with for shadow map generation (light view frustum)
    - Frustum culling does not seem to work correctly for certain ground tiles when the camera is
      very close
- Implement occlusion culling
- Implement outlining by pushing vertices in the direction of normals
- Is it correct that DepthBodyRenderer sets viewport while other renderers do not?
    - The reason for this is that depth body renderer has to bind framebuffer targets
    - Not sure it is correct that the renderer does the binding and setting of viewport though
    - Maybe it is a naming issue? It simply shouldn't be called "renderer"?
    - Try to think how the generic pipeline would like if composed declaratively by the user
- Write tutorial/documentation on gamma correction
- Write tutorial/documentation on skyboxes
- Glow should be independent of GLM: specializations of Uniform for glm types should be in Ape
- Try FBX format for 3D models
    - Use FBX SDK for importing the models
- The "Inversion" post-processing effect no longer seems to work
    - The image is extremely bright
    - Is this related to gamma?
    - I think it looked OK before we did omnidirectional shadow mapping
- Complete implementation of shadow mapping
   - Tightly fit lightSystem view matrices to the scene
   - Implement cascaded shadow maps at least for directional lights
   - Fix warning about texture base level and binding using NSight diagnostic tool (the standalone
     application, not the VS plugin)
       - This has been worked around by allowing to turn off debug mode from command line
   - Consider implementing (restoring?) PCF
   - Shadows seem to be neverending, this is not realistic
       - Try not using 1.0 vs 0.0 but something in the middle that changes with distance
       - Also, try playing with ambient lightSystem to compensate for this
- Performance has dropped a lot in ApeStudio, at least when not plugged to power
     - Try profiling through NSight
- Shouldn't LightSystemView cameras have the aspect ratio of the depth map rather than the aspect
  ratio of the display window?
    - In particular for point light shadow maps, if vertical FOV is 90 and AR is not 1, we get a
    - HFOV which is greater than (or lower than) 90, which means redundant or insufficient view
    - coverage 
- Qt window resizing has stopped working again
    - In fact it seems even going back to the commit that "fixed" it no longer works
- Implement normal maps
    - Have AssetLoader read normal maps
    - Have shader apply normal maps
- EffectSelector, SkyboxSelector, CameraSelector can be instances of the same template
    - Remove duplication by extracting the template
    - Same redundancy for EffectCollection, SkyboxCollection
- Create depth of field effect
- Unify the way GLFW windows and QT windows are created
    - Ideally, there should be a single "Engine" class
- Let shader programs (or at least effects) have names
    - Use that to select the initial effect in ApePlayer and ApeCreator
- Figure out a good way of reducing duplication in effect shaders
- Support wireframe rendering
- Implement techniques to compose effects into chains, possibly reusing a pool of FBOs
- callers of glViewport should do so through the Window object
- Implement normal visualization through geometry shaders
- (Re-)implement glowing based on view position and normal
- Player camera lookat direction is now different and non-deterministic when ApePlayer starts
    - Works correctly with ApeCreator
- Introduce different namespaces for packages (not just "ape")
- Do some performance benchmarking to compare rendering with VAOs and rendering with VBOs
- QtCreator workflow for setting things up is particularly unwieldy. Make it easier
- Refactor handling of Texture readout - should probably be part of AssetLoader, not GpuResource
    - Readout of texture introduces dependency on stb
- Let QtEngine and GLFWEngine own the renderer and its context, and enforce current window when
  constructing them
- Try and generalize GLFWEngine-based and Qt's event-based approaches
- Add CMake install target also handling correct deployment of dependencies
- Support flat shapes/meshes
