 - Consider renaming the Ape package to Engine
 - Add the <Package/...> prefix to include folders
 - Player camera lookat direction is now different and non-deterministic when ApePlayer starts
  - Works correctly with ApeCreator
 - Introduce different namespaces for packages (not just "ape")
 - Do some performance benchmarking to compare rendering with VAOs and rendering with VBOs
 - QtCreator workflow for setting things up is particularly unwieldy. Make it easier
 - Refactor handling of Texture readout - should probably be part of AssetLoader, not GpuResource
  - Readout of texture introduces dependency on stb
 - Let QtEngine and GLFWEngine own the renderer and its context, and enforce current window when
   constructing them
 - Try and generalize GLFWEngine-based and Qt's event-based approaches
 - Add CMake install target also handling correct deployment of dependencies
 - Support flat shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
