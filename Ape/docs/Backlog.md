 - Figure out why Blender models get loaded without textures
 - Create separate library for model import units using Assimp
 - Provide a camera-driving input handler as part of the engine
 - For efficiency, compute camera.transform * model.transform on CPU rather than in vertex shader
 - Extract utility functions to separate (general-purpose) library projects
 - Separate renderer from application and meshes (at least the part dealing with setting uniforms)
  - Only couple renderer to shader, mesh/shape coupling will only be at input (attribute) level, not uniform level
 - Create a library which can be used also from Qt
 - Make it possible to use the classes with both GLFW and with Qt (make it framework-independent in general)
 - Support planar shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
