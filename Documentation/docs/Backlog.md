 - Refactor handling of Texture readout - should probably be part of AssetLoader, not Glow
  - Readout of texture introduces dependency on stb
 - "Asset" does not seem to be the right name for the project
  - #include <Asset/RenderingContext.hpp> is weird
  - #include <Asset/Vertex.hpp> too
 - Reorganize project structure:
  - Extract the Shader, Texture, and Buffer out of Glow
  - Make Glow a functional group
  - Make a 3rdParty functional group (Glfw, Stb, Glad)
  - Make a Ape functional group including Scene, Engine, QtEngine, GlfwEngine, AssetLoader,
    TestScene, ApeCreator (rename to ApeStudio), ApePlayer
  - Make a Foundational functional group with Mathematics, CompilerSupport, Signal
 - Apply Rule of Zero to ownership wrappers
 - Player camera lookat direction is now different and non-deterministic when ApePlayer starts
  - Works correctly with ApeCreator
 - Let QtEngine and GLFWEngine own the renderer and its context, and enforce current window when
   constructing them
 - Try and generalize GLFW GLFWEngine-based and Qt's event-based approaches
 - Figure out why Blender models get loaded without textures
 - Add CMake install target also handling correct deployment of dependencies
 - Extract utility functions to separate (general-purpose) library projects
 - Support flat shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
