 - Figure out why Blender models get loaded without textures
 - Is it correct to have cameras be part of the scene?
   - Is it correct to force renderers to use a camera from a scene?

     updated...
 - Clean up CMake build system and factor out common boilerplate
  - Especially cmake/dependencies.cmake files for all projects
  - Have "Infrastructure" folder with top-level docs and backlog
 - Add CMake install target handling correct deployment of dependencies too
 - Create a separate library for Qt's SceneWidget
 - Create a separate library for model import units using Assimp
 - Extract utility functions to separate (general-purpose) library projects
 - Support flat shapes/meshes
 - Support "enterable", room-like shapes with an inner and outer layer with inverted normals
